# Fraud Card Detection

Fraud Card Detection is a machine learning-based project designed to identify and prevent credit card fraud. Leveraging advanced algorithms and real-time monitoring, this system offers an effective solution for detecting potentially fraudulent activities in credit card transactions.

# Fraud Card Detection

Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning.

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Fraud Card Detection system to identify potentially fraudulent credit card transactions. The solution involves preprocessing the dataset, training a machine learning model, and deploying it for real-time monitoring.

## Steps



1. Data Collection

Collect a dataset containing credit card transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

2. Data Preprocessing

- Explore the dataset.
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Normalize or standardize numerical features.
- Encode categorical features.

3. Feature Engineering

Enhance the model's ability to detect fraud by creating new features or modifying existing ones.

4. Model Selection

Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for fraud detection.

5. Model Training

Train the selected model on the training dataset, using techniques like cross-validation.

6. Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

7. Accuracy

Find its performance.
